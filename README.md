AI-based Skin Disease Prediction Model that uses deep learning to address the worldwide shortage of dermatologists, especially in rural and underserved areas. 
This scarcity can lead to delayed diagnoses and negative health outcomes for patients. The project proposes a scalable and affordable solution that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images of skin conditions. 
The system is designed to promptly identify common skin diseases such as melanoma, psoriasis, acne, and eczema.
